3. use diff -w -b  test#.init test0#_041su to see the differences.

NOTE: The diff program will report the following differences:
1. Immediate Sucessor Set  - This is because it is misspelled in the original file
2. Immediate Sucessors  - This is because it is misspelled in the original file
3. In some cases it diffs the natural loops. Even though it is the same list (and 
same order).
